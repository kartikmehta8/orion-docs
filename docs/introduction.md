# Introduction


:::tip From the creator
ChatGPT helped you get started with the backend in hours instead of days. Orion will help you get started with the backend **in minutes** instead of hours.

Sounds intriguing, doesn't it?

## Orion - Express on Steroids

*What if we told you that all you need to do is run **npm install**, and your Express server is fully configured and ready to go?*

Orion is a highly modular, scalable, and efficient backend framework that sits on top of Express.js. It aims to simplify backend development with its plug-and-play architecture, a customizable CLI, and an easy-to-extend infrastructure.

- **No more complex setup rituals**. Orionâ€™s CLI handles everything for you, so you don't need to chant `npm init` thrice under the moon.
- **No more reinventing the wheel**. Your wheelâ€™s already turbocharged here! ðŸš€

## Why Choose Orion Over Other Frameworks?

If youâ€™re tired of manually managing routes, middlewares, and connections with existing backend frameworks, then Orion is here to save the day!

### 1. CLI Commands
Most frameworks make you manually define everything and follow 21 different tutorial steps before you can say "Hello World." But Orion's CLI is like your coding assistant that generates everything you need with a simple command. Think of it as having a genie, but without the questionable wish limitations.

### 2. Dynamic Imports
Orion supports modular definitions for routes, controllers, and middleware, making them **pluggable, reusable, and customizable**. You no longer have to deal with lines of unmanageable code stuffed inside `app.js`. Now you can say, "Separate my concerns, routes, controllers, and middleware," and it just works!

### 3. Better than Just Being RESTful
While everyone else is busy trying to "REST" (pun intended), Orion aims to keep you **RESTed and ready**. You get a pre-configured, extendable, and structured system without the overhead.

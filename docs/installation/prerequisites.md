# Prerequisites

Before diving into Orion, you’ll need a few things to get started. Don’t worry, it’s a quick checklist!

## 1. **Node.js & Npm**
Orion is built on top of Node.js and Express, so having the latest stable version of Node.js installed is essential. You can download Node.js from [Node.js Official Website](https://nodejs.org).

```bash
# Verify your Node.js installation. Ensure you have version v22.8.0 or higher.
>>> node -v 

# Verify your Npm installation. Ensure you have version v10.8.3 or higher.
>>> npm -v
```

## 2. Git
Git is necessary to clone the Orion starter project and push your awesome changes. If you don't already have Git installed, you can get it from [Git's Official Website](https://git-scm.com).

```bash
# Verify your Git installation.
>>> git -v 
```

## 3. Basics of JavaScript & Express
While Orion takes care of most of the heavy lifting, having a basic understanding of JavaScript and Express.js will help you customize and extend Orion with ease. Don’t worry, Orion keeps things friendly and simple!

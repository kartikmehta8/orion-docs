### Who am I?

Iâ€™m the kind of programmer whoâ€™ll gladly spend 10 hours automating a task I could do in 10 minutes ðŸ˜†. Iâ€™m passionate about improving the **developer experience** because, ultimately, better DX leads to better UX. With a background in full-stack development, I crafted *Orion* to be the toolkit I always wished I hadâ€”one that lets you dive right into coding with reusable components, powerful CLI commands, and a modern, modular approach.

### Why Orion?

Orion isnâ€™t just another backend framework; itâ€™s built with your productivity in mind. Whether itâ€™s the dynamic configuration, CLI-generated modules, or structured folder architecture, every feature aims to streamline your development journey and help you focus on what really matters: **building incredible apps**.

Letâ€™s build something amazing together.

Happy coding! âœ¨
